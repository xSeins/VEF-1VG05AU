            <h2>CSGO GAMEPLAY</h2>
            	<p>Global Offensive, like prior games in the Counter-Strike series, is an objective-based, multiplayer first-person shooter. Two opposing teams, known as the Terrorists and the Counter-Terrorists, compete in game modes to complete objectives, such as securing a location to plant or defuse a bomb and rescuing or guarding hostages. At the end of each round, players are rewarded based on their individual performance with in-game currency to spend on other weapons or utility in subsequent rounds. Winning rounds rewards more money than losing does, and completing objectives such as killing enemies gives cash bonuses. Uncooperative actions, such as killing teammates, results in a penalty.</p>

			<h3 class="header-ENCE">ENCE</h3>
			
			<p>ENCE eSports was first founded in April 2013 by Petri "Procyon" Hämälä of Peliliiga, Toni "Chibulis" Jarkima, formerly of eXelon Gaming and Teemu "wabbit" Hiilinen of SEUL. On April 13, it was announced that the team known as TOOMUCHVIDEOGAMES would join the organization as their first CS:GO team. The relationship between the players and the organization soon broke down, however, mostly stemming from the looming instability of the roster, and the team was finally removed from ENCE in late May.</p>
