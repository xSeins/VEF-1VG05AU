	<p> lorem ipsum is simply dummy text of the printig and typesetting industry. lorem ipsum has been the industry's standar dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a gallery of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. it has survived not only five centuries, but also the lap into electronic typesetting, reimaning essentially unchanged. it was popularised in the 1060s with the release of Latreset sheet containing Lorem Ipsum opassage, and more recently with desktop publishing software like aldus PageMaker including version of Lorem Ipsum. </p>
